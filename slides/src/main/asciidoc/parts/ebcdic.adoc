== How to deal with EBCDIC


* Extented Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC)
* Axway CFT (Cross File Transfer ) No way CFT is an external component for us
* Bring Cobrix with the complexty of Apache Spark
* JZOS Batch Launcher and Toolkit Capabilities and Features (We do not want the complexity of z/OS)

The solution is to use a simple pretty and complete library called `JRecord`
