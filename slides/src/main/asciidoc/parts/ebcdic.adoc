== EBCDIC !! 

=== EBCDIC File Encoding

* EBCDIC = Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code
* Developed by IBM for mainframes and midrange systems
* 8-bit character encoding, different from ASCII
* Incompatible with ASCII â€” requires conversion for interoperability
* Often used in legacy banking, insurance, and government systems

=== Why EBCDIC Matters
====
[.column]

* EBCDIC files are still in use today
* Data exchanges between modern systems and mainframes require understanding of encoding

* Standard record definitions for reading EBCDIC-encoded files
* Used to define the structure of records in COBOL programs

* Common use: standard record definitions for reading EBCDIC-encoded files
* Ensures consistency in data structure definitions across COBOL programs
* Often used in conjunction with data conversion routines (e.g. EBCDIC to ASCII)


=== How to read EBCDIC files 



=== EBCDIC files, The JVM way 
* Java way 
    **  Use Java libraries like Apache Commons Codec or JSch (No time to code from st)
    **  Use EBCDIC encoding classes to read and convert files
    **  Example: Apache Commons Codec
