== EBCDIC

* EBCDIC = Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code
* Developed by IBM for **mainframes** and **midrange systems**
* 8-bit character encoding, different from ASCII
* Incompatible with ASCII — requires conversion for interoperability
* Often used in legacy banking, insurance, and government systems

=== Why EBCDIC Matters
====
[.column]

* EBCDIC files are still in use today
* Data exchanges between modern systems and mainframes require understanding of encoding

=== COBOL COPYBOOKS


[source,cobol]
----
01 CUSTOMER-RECORD.
   05 CUST-ID        PIC 9(5).
   05 CUST-NAME      PIC A(30).
   05 CUST-ADDRESS   PIC A(50).
   05 CUST-BALANCE   PIC S9(9)V99 COMP-3.  * Ex : ±999999999.99
----

* Standard record definitions for reading EBCDIC-encoded files
* Used to define the structure of records in COBOL programs
* Ensures consistency in data structure definitions across COBOL programs
* Often used in conjunction with data conversion routines (e.g. EBCDIC to ASCII)


=== How to read EBCDIC files 

* **CFT Axway** (We are not allowed)
* **Java™ Batch Launcher and Toolkit for z/OS® (JZOS) ** (No one want to touch mainframes)
* **Cobrix - COBOL Data Source for Apache Spark** (We have to drag the complexity of Apache Spark) 

=== EBCDIC files, The JVM way 
* Code something from scratch (We do not have much time !!)
* **JRecord** (Our best fit)

=== JRecord a road to Contribution
* JRecord is an open-source Java library 
* Available on GitHub https://github.com/bmTas/JRecord 
* You can use in your project (We encourage you to do so)
* You can contribute to it, every thing is welcome
   ** Use it and test it
   ** Report issues
   ** Bug fixes
   ** New features
   ** Documentation

=== JRecord, time to play with (Very Small Demo)
* Prepare an EBCDIC file
* Prepare a Cobol Copybook
* Prepare a Java program
* Start reding EBCDIC file and write into ASCII file
