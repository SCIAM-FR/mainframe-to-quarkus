== Why companies use mainframes today?
* *Reliability*:
  They are very resilient, with built-in redundancy and failover capabilities.
* *Availability*:
  They can run for long periods of time without downtime.
* *Security*:
  They have robust security features, including encryption, access controls, and auditing capabilities.
* *Scalability*:
  They can handle large volumes of transactions and data processing, making them suitable for high-demand applications.

== So why companies want to move away from mainframes?
* *Cost*:
  Mainframes are expensive to maintain and operate.
* *Talent*:
  There is a shortage of skilled mainframe developers, making it difficult to find and retain talent.
* *Integration*:
  They can be difficult to integrate with modern applications and systems.
* *Vendor lock-in*:
  They can create vendor lock-in, making it difficult to switch to other platforms or vendors.
* *Legacy code*:
  They often rely on legacy code and systems that can be difficult to maintain and update.
