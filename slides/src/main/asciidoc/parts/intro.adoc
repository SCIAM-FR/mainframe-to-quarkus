== Once upon a time...

[.column]
[%step]
* The Blue Orange insurance group decided to move its accountancy system to from the mainframe to microservices.
* We're talking about  100 subsidiaries, 1 billion accounts, and 200 million movements per day...
* The goal was to be able to process all this data as quickly as possible and to be able to scale the system.
* This talk will give you some insight on how we did it.

== WAP Application at Blue Orange

[.column]
[%step]
* WAP (Worldwide Accounting Platform) is the mainframe application that handles all the accounting of the group
* It is a monolithic COBOL application that has been in production for nearly 40 years
* It receives huge amount of data from all the subsidiaries
* A batch process runs every night to process all the data and generate the accounting entries

== What's a mainframe?

[.column]
--
[%step]
TIP: A mainframe is a large computer that is used for large-scale computing purposes that require greater availability and security than a smaller-scale machine can offer.

[%step]
TIP: Mainframes are used primarily by large organizations for critical applications, bulk data processing, and transaction processing.

[%step]
TIP: Main language is COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language) and OS is Z/OS

== Mainframes the good parts
[%step]
* *Reliability*:
  They are very resilient, with built-in redundancy and failover capabilities.
* *Availability*:
  They can run for long periods of time without downtime.
* *Security*:
  They have robust security features, including encryption, access controls, and auditing capabilities.
* *Scalability*:
  They can handle large volumes of transactions and data processing, making them suitable for high-demand applications.

== Mainframes the bad parts
[%step]
* *Cost*:
  They are expensive to maintain and operate.
* *Talent*:
  shortage of skilled mainframe operators and developers (COBOL).
* *Vendor lock-in*:
  IBM has a monopoly on the mainframe market.
* *Lack of flexibility*:
  They are often seen as rigid and inflexible, making it difficult to adapt to changing business needs.

== Requirement to move from mainframe
[%step]
* *Courage*:
 rewriting something that works is a big deal!
* *Value Creation*:
  The new system must be able to create value for the business.
* *A good use case*:
  If the system you want to migrate does only data ingestion and simple consultation, it is not worth the effort.




== Strategies to move from mainframe

* *code translation*:
  Translate the code from COBOL to Java (or any other language). You don't change the architecture, you just change the languageand you generate non-maintainable code.

* *Monolith wrapping*:
  Wrap the application in a concrete dome. Features are exposed as API without touching the content You don't change the architecture, you just change the language and you generate non-maintainable code.

* *code rewriting*:
  Rewrite the code from scratch. You change the architecture and you generate maintainable code.

* *code rewriting* is the best option but it is also the most expensive one.
* *code translation* is the worst option but it is also the cheapest one.
* *monolith wrapping* is also called Chernobyl coffin.
