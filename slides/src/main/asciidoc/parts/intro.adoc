== What's a mainframe?

[.column]
TIP: A mainframe is a large computer that is used for large-scale computing purposes that require greater availability and security than a smaller-scale machine can offer.

== Mainframes the good parts
* *Reliability*:
  They are very resilient, with built-in redundancy and failover capabilities.
* *Availability*:
  They can run for long periods of time without downtime.
* *Security*:
  They have robust security features, including encryption, access controls, and auditing capabilities.
* *Scalability*:
  They can handle large volumes of transactions and data processing, making them suitable for high-demand applications.

== Mainframes the bad parts
* *Cost*:
  They are expensive to maintain and operate.
* *Talent*:
  shortage of skilled mainframe operators and developers (COBOL).
* *Vendor lock-in*:
  IBM has a monopoly on the mainframe market.
* *Lack of flexibility*:
  They are often seen as rigid and inflexible, making it difficult to adapt to changing business needs.

== Requirement to move from mainframe
* *Courage*:
 rewriting something that works is a big deal!
* *Value Creation*:
  The new system must be able to create value for the business.
* *A good use case*:
  If the system you want to migrate does only data ingestion and simple consultation, it is not worth the effort.
